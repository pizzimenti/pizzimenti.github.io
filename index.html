In addition to cascading practice, we were introduced to the concepts of columns and how they are created and sized.

          <p>We also applied our knowlege of specificity as it applies to CSS selectors in order to <strong>override</strong> instances of CSS that we do not want to apply to a specific case or section of a site.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I was born in Portland. Though I spent my "uni years" travelling the globe and have only come back to reside here since 2014. Though I graduated from <a href="http://pdx.edu">Portland State</a> in 2007 with a degree in International Studies, I did my third year at the <a href="http://www.uba.ar">University of Buenos Aires</a>. I also studied humanities and economics at <a href="http://reed.edu">Reed College</a> for a year. In 2008 I was accepted to the Peace Corps and served in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso">Burkina Faso</a> for 27 months teaching computer literacy and building Ubuntu Linux labs. At the end of my service I received acceptance to the <a href="http://aup.edu">American University of Paris</a> and the <a href="http://www.univ-paris1.fr/">Sorbonne</a>. After three years of working on Masters degree in International Relations and Sustainable Development, I set to writing my thesis on <em>"Chinese Investment in Africa"</em>. In 2013 I travelled to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a> to do research and discovered that what the Chinese are doing in Africa is happening too fast and too opaquely to be researched in traditional academic fashion. I realized that the changes shaping the world are not being prepared for in the ivory towers of academia but in research labs and in the office of startups around the world. I abandoned my thesis and returned home to become a part of shaping that change.</p>

          <h2>Languages</h2>
          <p>Though I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Swift right now, I am fluent in French and Spanish.</p>
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>My hobbies are varied. I try dance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_improvisation">contact-improv</a> at least once a week. I occastionally DJ for <a href="http://www.sacredcircledance.com">ecstatic dance</a>. I write fiction when code is not flowing for me. I rock climb and do yoga and meditate on a daily basis. Those three help set my day right! The rest is an exploration and the travel bug has not left my system entirely. I hope to return to it and interweave it with my career as a developer.</p>
