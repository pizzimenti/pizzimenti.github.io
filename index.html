          <p>The purpose of this project was to practice some of our first week HTML and CSS elements and to see how inheritance works. In addition to cascading practice, we were introduced to the concepts of columns and how they are created and sized. The other major addition to our repetoire was the use of the 'float' element in CSS. Both the image to the left of this paragraph as well as the ordered list to the right are examples of float applied to a classful div.</p>

          <p>This project was our introduction to styling text in large blocks that repeated in other places throughout our html document. We learned the differences between <em>id</em> and <em>class</em> and how to create a link to an email address.</p>
          <p>We also applied our knowlege of specificity as it applies to CSS selectors in order to <strong>override</strong> instances of CSS that we do not want to apply to a specific case or section of a site.
